## Project Sweeping--Tidying Files And Collecting Data

The project is specifically designed for making management of generated data much easier from a specific worm (C. Elegans) simulator written in Java. In a nutshell, it collects scattered data, merged it into a single simple text file based database, then queries it to find a goodness of fit for certain parameters that can then be thrown into the java simulator.


## Requirements

* Python 3+


## Key Features

* Extracting information from data file path names and their contents
* Generating a database from the collected database
* Querying the database based on specified criteria
* Using queried data to find a goodness of fit for certain parameters


## Running

Just place the *"cleaner.py"* file outside the main data/results directory and then enter the following command in your terminal:
	python cleaner.py <results_path>
