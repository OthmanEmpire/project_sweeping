## Project Sweeping--Tidying Files And Collecting Data

The project is specifically designed to manage data generated from a simulator written in Java for the nematode C. elegans.

In a nutshell, it collects scattered data, merges it into a single simple text file based database, then queries it to find a goodness of fit for certain parameters that can then be thrown into the java simulator.

The project has been **halted** because an alternative solution has been reached. Many thanks to Dr. Netta Cohen for providing me with guidance and supplying the data throughout.


## Requirements

* Python 3+


## Key Features

* Extracting information from data file path names and their contents
* Generating a database from the collected database
* Querying the database based on specified criteria


## Running

The only files needed are the *cleaner.py* and *settings.ini* files. To run the code, specify the paths of the directories and files in the *settings.ini* file and then run normally run the *cleaner.py* script.
